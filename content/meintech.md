# Where are I am in tech

This is a list of things I know in tech ordered from most understanding to least understanding

1. Linux

I use linux more than once every day. I do all of my schoolwork on the command line, I have set up multiple debian,rpm,suse,portage,pacman based distros, and I have gone through the arch linux installation so much I can install it in 20 minutes. I have my Lpic esentials certification, and am working to get my LPIC-1 cert later in 2018. Here is a list of the distributions I have installed, and notes about them:

1. Ubuntu. I installed this one in first grade as covered in my about me section.
2. Debian. Once I had gotten myself into linux, I thought debian would be a great step away from ubuntu. 
3. Centos. 
4. Fedora. I have used this one more frequently, and I think it's pretty alright
5. Arch Linux. I installed arch linux multiple times, and I would definitly pick it if I was on old hardware
6. Gentoo. Gentoo by far is my favourite linux distro for multiple reasons, and I probably will write an article about it at some time.
7. Linux From Scratch. Linux from scratch is the most complicated and difficult linux distro to install. This distro took me 20 hours to install. The challenge comes from building every package from source. When I say build every package from source, I don't mean it in the gentoo-y way, I mean manually typing ./configure --prefix=/usr, make, make install for EVERY PACKAGE. The great thing about the install process was the fact that I got to see all of the packages and what they do for the system as a whole. 

2. Golang

While I have spent less time on golang then on linux, I would by far rate it as my best programming language. I have written a almost complete markdown lexer available on github in it, and I have written a chat server in it that could be used from 3000 miles away. That project was called LDCSP, and it is also available on github. Recently the project was refactored to be better, and easier to understand. 


## Other Programming langauges

I have tried to program in the following langauges:

1. Haskell

I started learning haskell a few months ago due to the want of understanding functional programming better, and so far I have completed the learn you a haskell book, and have written a program in haskell called collatzGraph which is on github, and computes command line graphs of collatz functions

2. Rust

I have started learning rust and have made it halfway through the rust programming langauge. My best project so far is an advanced factorial library.

3. C

C is a really, really difficult langauge. I have spent months programming it, and have even gone so far as to write a kernel in it.

4. Assembly

I have programmed in assembly, and have written my own MBR and bootloader in it.

3. Python

I learned python3 in 2017. The project I am the most proud of is a flashcard program that has it's own version control system built into it. 

4. NodeJS

I have not learned much of nodejs or javascript for that matter, but in building this website, I plan to learn a lot more of it, and during the summer of 2018, I want to go through freecodecamp.

5. Html/CSS

I have basically mastered HTML, and have gotten halfway through CSS. 

6. GNU MAKE

Most of my newer projects have some kind of makefile unless there is a build system already in place for that language. My most recent makefile is the one in the collatzGraph program


## Other operating systems


FreeBSD. I have installed freebsd, and used it a bit
OpenBSD. I burnt it onto a dvd
Windows. Was my primary operating system until I learned about linux
MacOS. I have a mac but in future will buy a linux based computer. I know next to nothing about macos as I stay in the terminal most of the time. 


## Other technologies. 

postgresql. I have written a fake bank application that uses postgres as its backend, and it is available on github
Mongodb. I have written an application that interfaces with mongo in c.
redis. I have not spent as much time on redis as I have spent on postgres, and mongo, but I have written an application that interfaces with redis in golang, and in Haskell.
nginx. My old website was written using nginx, but I have moved away from it in favour of the fasthttp package by valyala
Xen. Xen is an industry hypervisor, and I have set it up on multiple computers via the command line.
Kubernetes. I have went through the kubernetes tutorial, but I don't have a good project to work on for it yet. I do want to learn it in the future

## Cryptography

Diffie-Hellman. 

I have computed the mathematics for Diffie-Hellman key exchanges myself, and I thoroghly understand the math involved in it.



## Hacking

I have recently been getting into hacking as I wanted to learn how to program in C and assembly. I am not that good at it, but good enough to understand common security pitfalls of applications programmed in c, how sql injections work, and how to write more secure web applications.
